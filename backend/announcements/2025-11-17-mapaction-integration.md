# MapAction Maps Now Available

We're excited to announce that the latest MapAction crisis maps are now integrated into the IM Hub!

- Common Operating Pictures (COP)
- Sector-specific maps
- Infrastructure assessments
- Emergency telecommunications coverage

All maps can be viewed online or downloaded as packages for offline use.
